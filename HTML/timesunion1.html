          Q: How would you describe your leadership style?

          A: I would say that my brother and I lead by example. We are in the trenches with the troops leading with enthusiasm and modeling
          the type of effort we want them to demonstrate.

          Q: What characteristics do you look for in a candidate for employment, and why?
          <br>
          <br>
          A: We look for three things in this order:
          <br>
          </p>
          <p class = "bulletWrapper">
            •Does their personality fit with the team and are they easy to work with and pleasant to be around?

            •Are they sharp? If they aren't smart, they'll fall behind instantly and it won't work for either side.

          Q: What have you learned about what works for you as a leader, or what doesn't work?
          <br>
          <br>
          A: I know that I must show my enthusiasm and passion. That's the way I've always been and that's what people are drawn to.
          As far as what doesn't work, I know I have to clearly communicate my expectations. In the past, I've just expected people to do
          things a certain way only to be left frustrated when they didn't. It's not fair to have some expectations for someone that you
          don't communicate to them.
