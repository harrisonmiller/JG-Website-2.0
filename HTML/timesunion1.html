          Q: How would you describe your leadership style?

          A: I would say that my brother and I lead by example. We are in the trenches with the troops leading with enthusiasm and modeling
          the type of effort we want them to demonstrate.

          Q: What characteristics do you look for in a candidate for employment, and why?
          <br>
          <br>
          A: We look for three things in this order:
          <br>
          </p>
          <p class = "bulletWrapper">
            •Does their personality fit with the team and are they easy to work with and pleasant to be around?

          <p class = "bulletWrapper">
            •Are they sharp? If they aren't smart, they'll fall behind instantly and it won't work for either side.

          Q: What have you learned about what works for you as a leader, or what doesn't work?
          <br>
          <br>
          A: I know that I must show my enthusiasm and passion. That's the way I've always been and that's what people are drawn to.
          As far as what doesn't work, I know I have to clearly communicate my expectations. In the past, I've just expected people to do
          things a certain way only to be left frustrated when they didn't. It's not fair to have some expectations for someone that you
          don't communicate to them.
