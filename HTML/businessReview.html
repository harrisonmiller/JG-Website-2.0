        <h1 class = "title">How this Schenectady software company grew by almost 800 percent</h1>

          The Jahnel Group, a custom software development firm in Schenectady, New York, is expanding with new hires and new projects in 2017.
          </p>
          <p class = "contentMobile">
          Darrin Jahnel, founder and president of the Jahnel Group, said the firm is actively hiring for about four employees.
          <br>
          <br>
          "We hopefully will continue adding 10 people a year, or 20 people a year," Jahnel said. "We don’t have plans of slowing down."
          <br>
          <br>
          The Jahnel Group is a custom software design and development firm that started with a focus on educational software. In 2012, with five employees, the company expanded its strategy to include project work for other companies.
          <br>
          <br>
          Today, the Jahnel Group has 33 employees working out of a renovated, 19th-century mansion at 242 Union St. in Schenectady's Stockade Historic District. The company's six other employees work in a Manhattan office.
          <br>
          <br>
          Most of the Jahnel Group's business comes from building web applications for companies in New York City and Boston.
          Clients have included large institutions such as Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Google, as well as local companies,
          including Benetech.
          <br>
          <br>
          Jahnel said the company had $3.1 million in revenue in 2016, up from $1.9 million the previous year. Profits have been growing steadily, he said, since the company started taking on more outside projects in 2012.
          <br>
          <br>
          The company was No. 1 on the Business Review's Technology Startup Companies List with 33 employees based in Schenectady.
          <br>
          <br>
          As the business looks to grow, it has built up its internship program, called Forward Motion, to hire a significant number of its employees.
          <br>
          <br>
          Jahnel said 21 of the company's employees have come through an internship program. The firm's software engineers work mainly in the programming language Java.
          Most of the interns have come from University at Albany, Union College and schools in Rochester.
          <br>
          <br>
          "We are looking for people that have a nerd gene inside them," Jahnel said. "We don't care so much about experience. We can figure out a way to train them."
          <br>
          <br>
          Darrin Jahnel started the business with his brother, Jason Jahnel in 2009.
          <br>
          <br>
          The Jahnel brothers grew up in Schenectady County and went to Schalmont High School. Darrin Jahnel graduated from University at Albany and his brother Jason Jahnel graduated from SUNY Potsdam.
          <br>
          <br>
          Both worked for many years in New York City and received master's degrees from New York University's Stern School of Business.
          They moved back upstate in the mid-2000s to start consulting projects that turned into the Jahnel Group.
          <br>
          <br>
          "We’re excited to be in upstate New York," Jahnel said. "A lot of people knock upstate.
          What we have built here shows that it's possible that you can build something really special in upstate New York."
