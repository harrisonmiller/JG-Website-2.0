            <p>We offer manual testing, test automation, performance testing, and more. We can either place QA professionals on site, offer remote team-supplementation,

            <p>One of the best ways to improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of your testing process is to leverage the power of automated testing.
              When inexperienced teams try to create an automation framework, it often proves to be very difficult and expensive.</p>
            <p>We’ve utilized automated testing for over a decade at various clients and would love to use that experience to help you.</p>

            <p>We’ll give you our professional opinion on the best solution for you (even if Jahnel Group isn’t involved in the solution we recommend).
