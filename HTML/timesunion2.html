        <p class = "content" id = "indent">
          Once a year, the 40 employees at Jahnel Group put their normal duties on hold to learn to do a handstand, make beer taps
          and build game consoles. "War Week," as it's called, challenges software developers and sales people at the
          Schenectady-based custom software and consulting business to pursue things outside their comfort zones.
        </p>
        <p class = "content">
          It's one of the many leadership techniques brothers Darrin and Jason Jahnel, president and director of operations, respectively,
          have employed to make their company a unique and innovative place to work.
          <br>
          <br>
          "The reason this place exists is to give people a cool place to work," Darrin said. "We run the company with a servant's mentality."
          Whether in spontaneous hot sauce eating contests, company-wide push-up contests or road trips to their satellite office in New York City, the Jahnels have
          cultivated a loyal staff of mostly millennials who are ready to push themselves and, in turn, the company.
          <br>
          <br>
          "They take risks on people. ... and those people can get some amazing things done," said Jessie Zweigenthal, director of business
          development. She started with the company about 10 years ago with no real software skills but has since spearheaded a variety of projects.
          <br>
          <br>
          The company culture, employees agree, is due in part to how the Jahnels recruit potential workers. Before being officially hired,
          employees have to undergo a unique, sometimes months-long mentorship under Darrin's guidance. By getting to know the skills,
          weaknesses and, most importantly, personalities of potential employees, Darrin said "by the time we hire someone, I already
          know it's a home run."
          <br>
          <br>
          Those searches come at a significant cost to the company, he said, but are worth it in the end. He said roughly 50 percent of his
          time is spent on recruiting employees. "It's a huge time suck. But the way I see it is, let me waste 50 hours on 10 people to find
          that one right fit." The company has grown from five employees in 2012 to 40 today.
          <br>
          <br>
          "There's something they've found and developed into an internal formula," Zweigenthal said. "They're not looking at experience.
          They're looking at potential."
          <br>
          <br>
          Now with a solid and reliable crew established, Jahnel Group is revisiting its "dream" projects that were previously
          sidelined as they developed the company's consulting business.
          <br>
          <br>
          One such project is revamping their signature Samson's Classroom program for tablets. The game teaches children the 220 "sight"
          words that make up 50 percent of the English language so that they can "start off on the right foundation," Darrin said. The game
          has already been played more than 10 million times , but now they're trying to find a way to push it into more schools and households —
          a difficult task, given the competitive educational game market.
          <br>
          <br>
          But Darrin said he won't be deterred: "We'll just keep hustling."
